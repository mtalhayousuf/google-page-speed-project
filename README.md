# Website Page Speed Project

### Project Overview
---

The Website Page Speed Report is designed to analyze and monitor the performance of a website using Google PageSpeed Insights API. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement, ensuring that the website meets both user expectations and search engine standards. 

### Data Sources

- Google Page Speed Insight API: Used to retrieve detailed performance metrics for analyzing the website's speed, interactivity, and overall user experience.

### Tools

- PostgreSQL - Data Preparing
- PowerBI - Creating report

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the website performance data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the average load time for the website across different devices?
- How does interactivity vary between mobile and desktop users?
- Which elements contribute most to visual instability on the website?
- Are there specific pages with slower load times or performance issues?
- How does the websiteâ€™s performance compare to industry benchmarks?
